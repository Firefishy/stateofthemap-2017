State of the Map 2017 is taking place from August 18th to 20th 2017 in Aizuwakamatsu, Japan. We are looking forward to designing a program with you - the OpenStreetMap community. Thank you for the great responses to our [call for proposals](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2017/02/16/propose-your-session-to-state-of-the-map-2017/) and [community input](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2017/04/11/community-survey-for-the-state-of-the-map-2017-program/)! The final selection of talks and the building of the detailed program are making good progress thanks to our volunteers in the program committee. Watch here for more information soon.

In the meantime, here is the outline of the program:

- August 18th: first main conference day with presentations and discussions
- August 19th: second main conference day with presentations and discussions
- August 20th: activity day with code, documentation sprints, mapping and workshops

We also have the venue booked for set-up on August 17th. Should you be interested in using a room for an informal event please contact us.

*Your State of the Map organizing team.*
