The Fukushima Prefectural Museum (福島県立博物館, Fukushima Kenritsu Hakubutsukan) in Aizu has an extensive permanent exhibition that illustrates Japan's entire history, stretching from archaeological finds from the Jomon Period (300 BC) to artifacts of daily life in the 1950s. 
 
Please meet in the exhibition hall. Once the group is gathered, Takehiro Watanabe will walk with you to the museum and provide a guided tour (a small 610 Yen cash fee applies, payable to the museum).
