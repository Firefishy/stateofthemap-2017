Nir Yariv has developed a tool that uses modern natural language processing tools (currently using Microsoft's LUIS) to let users query the OSM database using plain English. It works by extracting the user's intent and parameters and converting them to an Overpass API query. Current queries aren't that complex, but this approach makes adding new queries relatively simple. Attend this session to find out more.
