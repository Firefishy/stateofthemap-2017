Navigation is one of the most important applications of a map. OpenStreetMap supports modelling a large range of navigational assets in the map data including turn restrictions and turn lanes that are used in advanced routing algorithms such as OSRM and graphhopper.

In this hands on workshop we will understand how to map the various features that are used in routing and guidance on OSM. This will include learning about established tagging practices, workflows for mapping and tools used to check and validate the navigation data.
