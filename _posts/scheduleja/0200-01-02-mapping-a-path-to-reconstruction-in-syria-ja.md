The value of VGI platforms like OSM is well established in short term disaster response efforts. The ongoing war in Syria has led to immense infrastructure damage, which will take years to restore. We propose that increased participation by Syrians in VGI data collection efforts can improve reconstructions plans. We present cases where VGI has been used by Syrians during the war and highlight the importance of enabling their participation in future reconstruction through OSM and other VGI platforms. Using quantitative methods, we characterize the “state of VGI data” for Syria (including OSM) with the intent of understanding the extent to which Syrians are (or are not) enriching data for their country. We conclude by discussing obstacles for attracting more contributions by Syrians and advances that VGI platforms like OSM can make to attract a more diverse contributor base and user base (including parties involved in long term development), by enabling facilitated VGI collection.
