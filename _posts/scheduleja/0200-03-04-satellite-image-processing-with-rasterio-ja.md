An introductory workshop to [Rasterio](https://mapbox.github.io/rasterio/), an open source tool we use at Mapbox to process petabytes of imagery, especially for people interested in drone imagery collection and quickly & easily processing it for mapping. We'll share our internal workflow with Rasterio, then quickly jump into a hands-on session to query imagery info and footprint, methods to stack bands, use rio-color for color adjustment, and use rio-hist for matching color-space.
