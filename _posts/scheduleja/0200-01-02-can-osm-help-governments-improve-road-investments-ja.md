The presentation will evaluate how OSM information can help governments improve the prioritization of road investments. This will be illustrated by examples of how OSM data has been leveraged across different country contexts by the World Bank.  A key concern has been whether OSM provides full appreciation of the extent of the network, as well as key road asset data specifications for improved investment and maintenance, especially for local roads. The session will illustrate how machine learning and smartphones are being used to augment this information, drawing on examples from Vietnam and Philippines.
