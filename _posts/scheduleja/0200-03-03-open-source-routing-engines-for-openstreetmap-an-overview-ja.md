Aside from the flagship routing engines OSRM and Graphhopper, there's quite a few other pieces of software vying for our attention, with names like Valhalla, Routino, BRouter, and Initero. This workshop aims to present an overview over currently available open source software, and their individual strengths and weaknesses.
