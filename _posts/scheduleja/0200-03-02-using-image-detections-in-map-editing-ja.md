This is an interactive workshop where we will go through editing in OpenStreetMap using Mapillary detections. Mapillary processes every photo contributed to identify a range of objects. Many of these objects correspond to tags in OpenStreetMap and can thus be very useful for map editing. Weâ€™ll go through these detections, how to make the most of them and look at the results of the photo walk we invite everyone to attend before SotM.
