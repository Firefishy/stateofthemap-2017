Vector tiles are nifty and will become part of the future web (and mobile) software stack. But something is striking: There are so many different styling languages (Mapnik XML, Mapnik CartoCSS, Mapbox GL JS, Tangram Styles) - but there's no convergence in sight, nor a higher level styling language. At least there exist some open source style editors, like Maputnik. But how to attract committers/cartographers who care about open source styles for appealing maps?
