MapRoulette has been around for a few years, and mappers have fixed close to a million things in OSM using it. Not everyone agrees that MapRoulette, and tools like it, are good for OSM. MapRoulette, they argue, encourages 'Armchair Mapping'; edits made by people far away who do not know the local situation. Or worse, MapRoulette puts mappers to work much like machines; they map without really thinking about what they are doing.

In this talk, I want to explore the good, the bad and the evil in QA tools like MapRoulette, and propose ways forward for QA tools in OSM. I especially invite you to attend if you are critical of MapRoulette!
