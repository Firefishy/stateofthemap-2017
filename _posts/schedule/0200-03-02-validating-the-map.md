OpenStreetMap is used in wide variety of applications like navigation, visualisation, urban planning, art and more. An active community is more important than ever to understand, evaluate map-breakages, and to protect the map. Mapping errors, accidental edits and intentional vandalism affect more users of the map than before.

This workshop session is aimed at introducing validation QA tools, inspecting and spotting issues in a changeset, understanding feature history, fixing relations, and to discuss compare functions for suspicious edit detection. At the end of the session, you will have skills to use validation QA tools and to validate your neighborhood.
