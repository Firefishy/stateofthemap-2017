Join Edoardo from Mapillary for a photo walk around the grounds of Aizuwakamatsu Castle. We'll break into groups and cover different routes as we learn how to use the app, action cams and 360ยบ cams. If time permits we'll try uploading as well. Download the Mapillary app to your device before the event and take the opportunity to stretch your legs around this historic venue. We'll be meeting at 11am in Room 1 of Aizuwakamatsu City Culture Centre. The walk itself should take only 20 minutes, after which we can come back and upload the imagery through the day.
