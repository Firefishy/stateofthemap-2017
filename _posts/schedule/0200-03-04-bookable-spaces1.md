What area of OpenStreetMap are you involved in, and do you want to discuss specific subjects with like-minded people? The engineering group, mappers that cycle, those wanting to increase diversity and representation,… we’ve had some great sessions before.

Edit the [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_of_the_Map_2017/Breakout_sessions) page to suggest a group or a topic, so others can get interested in joining you. During the conference, confirm your session with the event team for its time slot to be decided.
