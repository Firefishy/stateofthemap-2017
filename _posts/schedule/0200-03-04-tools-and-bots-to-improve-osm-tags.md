There are 64,000+ tags in OSM, but 42,000+ of them are used on 10 objects or less. The variety of values is even more diverse. Any tag needs to be well understood and documented to be useful by data consumers and mappers alike. This session is an attempt to bring together mappers and data consumers, to establish a better tagging system, and discuss the need for (semi-)automated community-driven tools to improve tag quality.
